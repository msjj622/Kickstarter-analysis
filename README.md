# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to know what months Theater got mostly successful in the fundraising goals and what amount of fundraising goals are mostly successful in the play sector. Since Louise knows that play Fever came close to this fundraising goal in a short period, She wanted to know how the play sector has a relationship with launch dates and the amount of funding goals. If we can provide the outcomes of what months got successful in Theater based on the launch dates and what amount of funding goals are mostly successful in the play sector, she can acknowledge what things made successful in funding and be used for future funding plans.

## Analysis and Challenges: 
**Overview of Analysis**
Based on the Kitckstarter Challenge chart, [Kickstarter_Challenge Screenshot](https://github.com/msjj622/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Screenshot_1.png).

**Challenges**
The most difficult thing I found during this challenge is to layout the legend based on the amount of money with texts on the chart for outcomes by launch date. The legend kept showing in order from 1000 to 4999 to 45000 to 49999 and Greater than 50000 and less than 1000. I wanted to put less than 1000 at first and put the amount in order to asceding. I found out how to add custom list for mac.

First of all, go to Excel 'preference' and click 'Custom lists' and click 'Add' and type as you want to be listed. After that, right click the leged on the chart, go to 'Sort' and 'more sort options' and 'Options' and click the list you created previously and hit 'okay'. Now you will see the chart based on the amount of money with texts which starting less than 1000 and finishing with Greater than 50000.


## Results: 
Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
