# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to know what months Theater got mostly successful in the fundraising goals and what amount of fundraising goals are mostly successful in the play sector. Since Louise knows that play Fever came close to this fundraising goal in a short period, She wanted to know how the play sector has a relationship with launch dates and the amount of funding goals. If we can provide the outcomes of what months got successful in Theater based on the launch dates and what amount of funding goals are mostly successful in the play sector, she can acknowledge what things made successful in funding and be used for future funding plans.

## Analysis and Challenges: 
**Overview of Analysis**

Creating parent category and years in an excel shown as an image, [Kickstarter_Challenge Screenshot](https://github.com/msjj622/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Screenshot_1.png). and filering 'Theater' in parent category and years in a pivot table, I could get data analysis about which months got successful as shown this image. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/msjj622/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) Now I know May, Jun and July are mostly successful months of years.

Second, based on the chart from less than 1000 to 4999 in the dollar-amount ranges are mostly successful in a play sub category. Also from 35000 to 44999 are second successful range as well. It clearly shows that play in May, jun and July are mostly successful launch date with the amoun of fundrizing goal of less than 1000 to 4999. Louise can plan future funding based on these analysis to be successful.

**Challenges**

The most difficult thing I found during this challenge is to layout the legend based on the dollar-amount ranges with texts on the chart for outcomes based on goals. The legend kept showing in order from 1000 to 4999 to 45000 to 49999 and Greater than 50000 and less than 1000. I wanted to put less than 1000 at first and put the dollar-amount range in order to asceding. This is probably only issue with mac users. But, I found a solutions how to add custom list for mac.

First of all, go to Excel 'preference' and click 'Custom lists'. You will see this window as this image [Custom_List](https://github.com/msjj622/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Custom_list.png). and click 'Add' and type as you want to be listed like shown 'list entries:' After that, right click the leged on the chart, go to 'Sort' and 'more sort options' and 'Options' and click the list you created previously and hit 'okay'. Now you will see the chart based on the amount of money with texts which starting less than 1000 and finishing with Greater than 50000.

## Results: 
Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
The first one is the months of May, jun and july are mostly successful in theater outcomes by launch date. It clearly shows that launch dates are close to summer, it seems mostly successful compared to fall and winter seasons. Secondly, according to the chart, December seems to overlap with success and failure. December is the lowest number of successes in theater outcomes by launch date. Half of them are successful and the other half are failed in a grand total, which means December is not a good lunch date for new projects.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
